# GetStartedWinForms

This is a WinForms application created based on the tutorial <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/winforms">"Getting Started with Windows Forms"</a>. It uses a SQLite database, Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to load data from the database and track changes.

The main functionalities of the application are displaying existing categories and products related to each of these categories (one-to-many), modifying and deleting existing entries, adding new entries and saving all changes made.
